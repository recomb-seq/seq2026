## Posters

{{ site.title }} invites the submission of abstracts for the poster track. Posters can also be simultaneously submitted for display at one of the satellite meetings' poster sessions. Posters accepted to both RECOMB and one of the satellite meetings are welcome to be displayed at both meetings.

Please submit a 250-word abstract of your poster that describes its primary results. Your submission should also include the author(s), their affiliations, the presenting author, the e-mail address of at least the contact author and the poster title as requested by the submission system. The abstract should be plain text and should not contain any figures. Accepted poster abstracts will be published as submitted in the conference book of abstracts.

Please visit the [EasyChair]({{ site.links.easychair }}) system to submit your poster abstract. The submission system will close on **{{ site.deadlines.poster_submission }}**. Acceptance notifications will be sent out on **{{ site.deadlines.poster_notification }}**. Pending capacity, late poster submissions will be taken until **{{ site.deadlines.late_poster_submission }}**. For further questions, please contact the [Posters Chair]({{ site.links.posters_chair }}).
